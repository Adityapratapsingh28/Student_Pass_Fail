# Student_Pass_Fail

This project develops a machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their grades. The dataset contains student performance data, and the model is trained and tested with an accuracy goal of at least 90%. The project includes data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation metrics, and performance tuning to improve prediction accuracy.
